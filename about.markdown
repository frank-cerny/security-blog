### WHOAMI

My name is n0tac0p. I am an application developer with an interest with securing networks and spreading awareness of security matters. This modest blog will contains all writeups for the website Hack The Box, as well as whatever I see fit. It is quite basic at this point, but I will continue to grow it as time goes on.

### Note on References
When I include a link to something in a post, you will find the notation: ([n]) at the end of the link the link is in (where n is a number). You can find the link to the reference and a brief description of it by finding the same number in the references section at the bottom of the post.

### Contact
For now, please contact me on Hack The Box (either the forums or the main site). I will get back to you as fast as I can :).
